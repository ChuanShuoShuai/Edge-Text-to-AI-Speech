# How to use?

【PC】

Enter a paragraph and press the generate button. Click the shortcut keys [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[U] in the new interface "Reading Page" to start reading aloud. To return to this interface, simply go back to the tab above the browser. To remove the generated new page, click [X Close Tab].

Note: If your non Edge browser also has AI voice function, you can use it without restrictions~

【Mobile】

Enter a paragraph and press the generate button. In the new interface, click on the menu bar below the browser in the "Read aloud page", and then click the [Read aloud] button. The mobile end will present a new window. To return to this interface, simply click on the Shuaiguo website in the [Multi Window View (2)] below the browser. If you want to remove the generated new page, click on the [Multi Window View (2)] below the browser, and then close the "Read Loud" tab.

Note: If your non Edge browser also has AI voice function, you can use it without restrictions~

【Immersive mode】

Open Google Chrome (if available on other browsers), then right-click to open in reading mode, select all "Read Page" texts (Ctrl+A), and immerse yourself in the sidebar.

Note: Other browsers can directly view text after opening immersive mode, while Google Chrome is more complicated. Changing the background color can also achieve immersive effects. Please immerse yourself according to your personal preferences.

【Select file】

Computer end: Click and select a file.

Mobile version: [Android] will pop up the "File Manager", then select the file in the corresponding folder (the gray icon is temporarily not supported).

[Apple]"My iPhone" or other "File Browser" will pop up. You need to create a new text in the "File" or "File Browser" app in advance, or use "Share" to import it from other apps into the "File" or "File Browser" app in order for the browser to read the file (the gray icon is temporarily not supported).

【Font settings】

You can add your favorite font in "F12 Browser Debugging", and the specific format has been open sourced and marked. You can try some eye friendly fonts or artistic fonts.

【Pop up method】

This feature is only valid on the computer side (browsers that support multiple tabs). When you choose the independent window mode, you can get a very simple window with only one loud reading with an address bar, which you can directly click to use. Of course, shortcut keys are also effective, and this feature is very suitable for reading focused scenes.

【Background setting】

When you generate a custom color, the new window will automatically adopt that color. It is worth noting that the font color will change according to the background color to make it easier to observe the text. The font will be black in light colors and white in dark colors. In addition, when you generate multiple pages, these colors are independent, and even if you change the color on the Shuaiguo website, you will still retain the color of the generated pages, so you can generate multiple pages with different colors.
